## Troubleshooting

- **No songs appear:**  
  Make sure your `.mp3` files are in the `songs` folder and have the correct extension.

- **VLC not found:**  
  Ensure VLC is installed and accessible. On Windows, the installer usually adds VLC to your PATH automatically.

- **Other issues:**  
  Make sure all dependencies are installed and you are using a supported Python version.
