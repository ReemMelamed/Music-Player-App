```

- All UI code is under `widgets/` (modularized by component).
- All core logic (VLC, favorites, playlists, utils) is under `core/`.
- The main player logic is in `widgets/player/main_player.py`.
- Place your `.mp3` files in the `songs/` folder at the project root.

## Troubleshooting

- **No songs appear:**  
  Make sure your `.mp3` files are in the `songs` folder and have the correct extension.

- **VLC not found:**  
  Ensure VLC is installed and accessible. On Windows, the installer usually adds VLC to your PATH automatically.

- **Other issues:**  
  Make sure all dependencies are installed and you are using a supported Python version.

## Running on Linux

1. **Install Python 3 and pip** (if not already installed):
   ```sh
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
   ```

2. **Install VLC:**
   ```sh
   sudo apt install vlc
   ```

3. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip3 install PyQt6 python-vlc
   ```

4. **Run the app:**
   ```sh
   python3 main.py
   ```

### Creating a Desktop Icon (Linux)

To create a desktop shortcut (icon) for the app:

1. Create a file named `MusicPlayer.desktop` on your desktop:
   ```sh
   nano ~/Desktop/MusicPlayer.desktop
   ```
2. Paste the following content (update the paths if needed):
   ```
   [Desktop Entry]
   Version=1.0
   Type=Application
   Name=Music Player
   Exec=python3 /home/youruser/Music/Music-Player-App-1/main.py
   Icon=audio-x-generic
   Terminal=false
   ```
3. Save and exit (`Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl+X`).
4. Make it executable:
   ```sh
   chmod +x ~/Desktop/MusicPlayer.desktop
   ```
5. Double-click the icon to launch the app.

1. Install the required package:
   ```sh
   pip install pywin32
   ```
2. Save the following script as `create_shortcut.py` in your project folder:
   ```python
   import os
   import sys
   from win32com.client import Dispatch

   def create_shortcut():
       desktop = os.path.join(os.path.join(os.environ['USERPROFILE']), 'Desktop')
       shortcut_path = os.path.join(desktop, "Music Player.lnk")
       python_path = sys.executable
       script_path = r"c:\\...\\Music-Player-App-1\\main.py"

       shell = Dispatch('WScript.Shell')
       shortcut = shell.CreateShortCut(shortcut_path)
       shortcut.Targetpath = python_path
       shortcut.Arguments = f'"{script_path}"'
       shortcut.WorkingDirectory = os.path.dirname(script_path)
       shortcut.IconLocation = python_path
       shortcut.save()
       print("Shortcut created on Desktop!")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       create_shortcut()
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python create_shortcut.py
   ```
4. A "Music Player" icon will appear on your desktop. Double-click to launch the app.
